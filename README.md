# Sokoban-Solver

# Project Description
Sokoban Solver is an implementation of various searching techniques to solve the game of Sokoban.The techniques used for this project include Breadth First Search, Uniform Cost Search and A* search.
<br></br>
Input is 5 lines defining the board :
sixeH sizeV, e.g. "3 5"
nWallSquares a list of coordinates of wall squares, e.g. "12 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 1 2 3 3 1 3 3 4 1 4 3 5 1 5 2 5 3"
nBoxes a list of coordinates of boxes, e.g. "1 3 2"
nStorageLocations a list of coordinates of storage locations, e.g. "1 4 2"
playes initial locatin x and y, e.g. "2 2"
<br></br>
Output gives the moves taken by Sokoban to insert the boxes in the goals, and the duration for the algorithm to run on the problem.
We have implemented BFS,UCS, and A* Search algorithms and user is prompted to select one of them at run.

# Requirements
Python3 is required for this implementation

# Implementation Instructions

To run a given testcase put it inside the testcase.txt file and run main.py
Then select the algorithm you want to run.
After the run you can check the board design in boardlayout.txt
